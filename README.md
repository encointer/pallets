## Dev Hints

### Benchmarking
You can automatically update the `WeightInfo` definitions by running the benchmarks in an encointer-node with the
script in the node's repository: `./scripts/benchmark_runtime.sh` and uncommenting the line with 
`frame-weight-template-full-info.hbs` (see the script's documentation).

### Serializing
* There is a know issue with serializing u-/i128 in the json-rpc crate, see (https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/4641). 
This affects us predominantly when serializing fixed point numbers in the custom RPCs. There is a custom serialization
shim as a workaround for that issue in [ep-core](./primitives/core), which can be used as custom serde attribute like:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(feature = "serde_derive", derive(Serialize, Deserialize))]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "serde_derive", serde(rename_all = "camelCase"))]
pub struct BalanceEntry<BlockNumber> {
	/// The balance of the account after last manual adjustment
	#[cfg_attr(feature = "serde_derive", serde(with = "serialize_fixed"))]
	pub principal: BalanceType,
	/// The time (block height) at which the balance was last adjusted
	pub last_update: BlockNumber,
}
```

We also apply substrate's standard of serializing with `camelCase`.
